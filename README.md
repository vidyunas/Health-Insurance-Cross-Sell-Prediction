# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction

# Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will be interested in purchasing an additional insurance policy (cross-selling) based on their demographic, vehicle, and policy information. This information can help the insurance company to tailor their marketing and sales strategies to target customers who are more likely to purchase additional insurance policies.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Insurance Cross Sell Prediction dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains over 381109 customers, of which only 12% have purchased additional insurance policies. The dataset includes features such as the customer's age, gender, driving license, vehicle age, and policy details.

# Data Preprocessing
Before building the machine learning model, we need to preprocess the data to prepare it for training. This includes:

Handling missing values and outliers, if any
Encoding categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Addressing class imbalance by oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions) Model Selection and Training.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

# Model Selection and Training
For this project, we will compare the performance of several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. We will train each model on the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Results
Based on our evaluation metrics, we will select the best performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters to further improve its performance. We will also visualize the results using various plots and charts to gain insights into the model's predictions.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will purchase an additional insurance policy based on their demographic, vehicle, and policy information. By identifying potential cross-selling opportunities, insurance companies can tailor their marketing and sales strategies to target customers who are more likely to purchase additional insurance policies, which can result in increased revenue and customer satisfaction.
